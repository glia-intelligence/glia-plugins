# Claude Connector Directory

> **Note:** This directory was compiled as of February 2026. New connectors are added regularly. If a connector you need isn't listed here, do a web search to check — it may have been added since this directory was last updated. Connectors are very rarely removed, so if something is listed here, it almost certainly still exists.

## How to Add Connectors in Claude Desktop

1. Open the **left-hand pane** in the Claude Desktop app
2. Click **Customize**
3. Click **Connect your tools**
4. Browse or search for the connector you need and enable it

**Team/Enterprise users:** The owner of your organization may need to enable connectors before they appear for you. If you don't see a connector that should be there, check with your workspace admin.

You can also add a **custom connector** if you have an MCP server URL.

## Notes for the Workflow Automation Skill

When recommending connectors during the connector setup phase:

1. **Always prefer the Featured/First-Party connectors** listed above — these are one-click setups within Claude Desktop
2. **If no first-party connector exists**, check if the user's system has a web interface accessible via Claude in Chrome
3. **Community/Local MCP servers** are a last resort for technical users — they require local setup and are not recommended for the typical workshop participant
4. **This directory may be incomplete** — always do a web search to verify connector availability if you're unsure, especially for newer or niche services
5. **Connectors are rarely removed** — if a user can't find a connector listed here, it's most likely a navigation issue (remind them: left pane → Customize → Connect your tools)
